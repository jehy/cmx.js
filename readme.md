# cmx.js - a library for authoring [xkcd-style](http://xkcd.com) comixes

# This fork is working
Code in [source repository](https://github.com/darwin/cmx.js) is really hard to launch, since it uses ancient technologies
like bower, yeoman, ruby, grunt, coffeescript, and only works on Node 6.

So I fixed some things and built a docker container with all of it, so you can launch it easily.
Code should work as is, or you can use [docker image](docker-compose.yml).

No other changes besides fixes are done - it should look exactly like many years ago.
